## The mission

> Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

* More difficult, more challenging
* Great questions lead to great answers
  * Android begins from the question of "what if the world has one center OS?"
  * Gmail begins with the question "Why 20MB?"
    * No more deletion!
  * Gmail store "unlimited" emails. What about Photos?
    * Google Photos comes in handy.

## The culture

* It's all about sharing
  * TGIF: Friday meeting, globally.
    * Create inspirations.
    * __Creativity begins from sharing.__
    * Share "failed" experience
      * __Transparency__ is the keyword
      * Employee __trust__.
* Not only share, but __feedback__.
