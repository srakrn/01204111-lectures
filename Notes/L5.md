# Control Structure: Selections

## Boolean data type
use `bool` for datatype
~~~
  bool a = false;
~~~

### Assignment operators
* `==` for equal operator
* `!= ` for NOT equal operator
  * Tips: `!` is the negation (นิเสธ) in C#; like the way negation of `p` is `~p` mathematically
* `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` says it all.
* `Note: ` `Console.WriteLine(a)` when `a`'s datatype is `bool` will write `True` or `False`.

* `&&` for conditional and
* `||` for conditional or
  * `&` or `|` is usable, yet makes the code run slower
  * `&&` check if one side is false and simply return false, while `||` check if one side is true and simply returns true.

#### Operation precedence
Boolean operators has almost the LEAST importance in C# (and many others) programming.

## Control structure
* __Sequence__: เรื่อยๆ มาเรียงๆ
* __Subroutine__: Method
* __Selection__: `if`, `switch`
* __Repitition__: `for`, `while`

### Subroutine: Methods
* Methods structure
~~~
  static int timesTwo(int a){
      return a*2;
  }
~~~
  * returns int type;
  * `static bool` does not return any value.
    * That's why `Main()` function type is bool. Why on earth would someone call `Main()` and expected it to return the function?
      * Yet, sometimes declaring `Main()` with `return 0` is practical.
