# Method Overloading

## What's a method?
* Oh damn guys! Method is the method!
  * Sometimes called __subroutine__, as it's a predefined routine for more than once occurring routine.

## Class
Two main roles: modules and blueprints:

### Modules
* For methods: `ClassName.MethodName(args)`

### Blueprints
* For object creation,
* Calls method of the object: `ObjectName.MethodName(args)`
